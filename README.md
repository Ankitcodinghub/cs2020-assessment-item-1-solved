Title: CS2020 ‚Äì Software

Programming Note: This assessment accounts for 25% of your total mark of the course.

Learning Outcomes

On successful completion of this component a student will have demonstrated competence in the following aspects:

‚Ä¢ Ability to write and run basic Java applications

‚Ä¢ Ability to judge how Java applications should be structured

‚Ä¢ Understanding and ability to apply, techniques to support correct code in a Java application

Report Guidance &amp; Requirements

This assessment includes coding tasks and a final written task outlining the steps taken as aforementioned. You will be provided with a template code for some of the classes to help you get started. The goal of this assessment is to build a simple Battleships game with a text-based interface. The goal of the game is to guess the location of all your opponent‚Äôs ships positioned on a 2D grid before your opponent discovers your ships.

You‚Äôll also find submission details, which you need to follow, at the end of this document.

Use Git to Save Your Work

While we‚Äôre not marking your use of Git in this assignment, you are strongly encouraged to do this work inside a Git repository. By doing that you gain the benefit of rolling back your edits, or doing work in branches, and then merging it to the main branch as you accomplish tasks along the way.

If you push your work regularly to GitHub, then you can easily (a) pull it into Codio and carry on if you lose your laptop, and (b) move it to a different device if you need to.

By the way, ‚Äòregularly‚Äô in this case means making a commit every 5 or 10 minutes locally, and then pushing it to GitHub every hour. Small local commits mean you can roll back small changes without much trouble, and pushing remotely less frequently stores your work safely offsite.

To test your progress the project template includes 11 tests. They are initially commented out so they don‚Äôt throw compilation errors because they expect certain classes that you will have to create.

With a clean template after running mvn clean test you should see the following:

Once you have completed a subtask, uncomment relevant test(s) and corresponding imports. For example, after completing task 1.1. your test file should look like this:

Note that not all tasks have tests defined. Make sure you mention in the report which tasks you have completed.

In later stages, you can use the command mvn package to generate a jar file which then can then run with java -jar assignment1-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar &lt;your parameters&gt; from the target folder. Alternatively, you can run the main method directly with mvn compile exec:java Dexec.mainClass=‚ÄùCS2020.assignment1.game.RunGame‚Äù -Dexec.args=‚Äùarg1 arg2 arg 3‚Ä≥.

When the game starts, the console output should be similar to this (depending on the grid size and number of ships specified):

The following provides a detailed description of each task. To complete these tasks, follow the instructions and ensure you use the provided template. All processes taken to run the final project must be clearly described. For submission instructions refer to the later sections.

**Please read all the information below carefully**

Task 1: Create Battleship objects (10 points)

1.1) Create BattleShip.java that extends AbstractBattleShip class. Define a class constructor that sets the name of the ship based on the passed method parameter, and randomly decides the ship orientation by assigning ‚Äúhorizontal‚Äù or ‚Äúvertical‚Äù values in the shipOrientation variable defined in

the abstract class. You can utilise the Random class and nextInt () to give you random integers within certain range.

1.2) Implement the getter and setter methods defined in the AbstractBattleShip class to provide access to the class variables (i.e., getName (), getHits(), getShipOrientation(), sethits(), getShipCoordinates(), and setShipCoordinates())

1.3) Implement the functionality of the checkAttack method. The method should check if the ship has been already destroyed (i.e., received three hits) and return false if this is the case even if the attack coordinates match the position. If any of ship‚Äôs coordinates match the attack coordinates represented by the row/column parameters passed to the method and the number of hits is less than 3 then the method should return true. In case of a successful attack, the method should also increase the amount of hits registered for this ship.

Task 2: Implement the functionality to display the game grid (35 points)

2.1) Create GameGrid.java that extends the AbstractGameGrid.java. Create a class constructor that takes three inputs width, height, and number of ships that should be created. The constructor should create a 2D String array representing the grid and initialize it using the initializeGrid method defined in the abstract class with every element having value set to ‚Äú.‚Äù.

2.3) Implement the functionality of placeShip method. This method should place ships randomly on the grid. You can utilise the Random () object and nextInt () to give you random integers within certain range. Make sure that you respect the ship orientation (either vertical or horizontal) when placing the ship on the grid. Overlapping ships are fine. However, make sure that you don‚Äôt try to place ships that would ‚Äúoverspill‚Äù from the grid (e.g., first element of the horizontal ship to the last element on the right). Update the grid so the ships are denoted by the ‚Äú*‚Äù symbol. Each ship object should have it‚Äôs coordinates stored in the shipCoordinates array (defined in the AbstractBattleShip) and all ship objects should be stored in the ships array (defined in the AbstrcatGameGrid).

Example of two ships positioned on the grid:

.***..*‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶‚Ä¶*‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶‚Ä¶*‚Ä¶

2.4) Create PlayerGameGrid.java and OpponentGameGrid.java that extend GameGrid class.

Within both classes define method printGrid which when called will print either ‚ÄúPlayer‚Äôs grid‚Äù or

‚ÄúOpponent‚Äôs Grid‚Äù message followed by the contents of the grid. Opponent‚Äôs grid should not reveal the position of the ships (i.e., ‚Äú*‚Äù symbols) but should show the hits (i.e., using the ‚ÄúX‚Äù symbol), misses (i.e., using the ‚Äú%‚Äù symbol), and everything else as ‚Äú.‚Äù.

Task 3: Create a mechanism for playing game in rounds and handling the attacks (35 points)

3.1) Create Game.java which should implement the GameControls interface. Define a class constructor that will create and initialise player‚Äôs and opponent‚Äôs grids with the appropriate size of the grid and the number of ships using the classes defined in 2.4. The constructor should take three parameters number of rows, number of columns, and number of ships to be placed on the grid.

Implement getter methods to retrieve player‚Äôs and opponent‚Äôs grids.

3.2) Implement the exitGame method that ends the program if the input contains value ‚Äúexit‚Äù. The following message should be printed into the console before exiting: ‚ÄúExiting game ‚Äì thank you for playing‚Äù. Note: There are no automated tests for this sub-task

3.3) Implement checkVictory method that checks whether either all opponent‚Äôs or player‚Äôs ships have been destroyed (i.e. all received three hits). If all ships have been destroyed message should printed into the console informing the player who won by printing:

‚ÄúYou have won!‚Äù

Or

‚ÄúYou have lost!‚Äù

3.4) Implement the playRound method. The method should expect input in a form of a string where there are two numbers separated by ‚Äú,‚Äù. First number represents the x coordinate and the second number the y coordinate on our grid (hint: you will need to split the string and parse characters into numbers). Complete the method so the user input is used to check the opponent‚Äôs grid for ship positions. If the coordinate matches part of the ship print ‚ÄúHIT &lt;ship name&gt;!!!‚Äù into the console, update the number of hits recorded in the corresponding ship object, and update the grid with symbol ‚ÄúX‚Äù denoting the hit.

0,1

HIT Ship 1!!!

.X‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..

‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

If there is no ship in that position, print ‚ÄúMISS!!!‚Äù into the console and update the grid with symbol ‚Äú%‚Äù denoting the miss.

0,2

MISS!!!

.X%‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

After the user input is processed, the method should generate a random set of coordinates to simulate an attack on player‚Äôs grid. No need to be very sophisticated here at this time (e.g., utilising the positions of partially hit ships) but if you have time you can make your ‚Äúbot‚Äù smarter.

NOTE: you can break up your code in as many helper methods as you want to avoid a code repetition.

Task 4: Complete your code to implement remaining game controls (10 points)

Note: There are no automated tests for this task

Create a RunGame.java that starts your game. The following functionality should be implemented:

4.1) RunGame class contains the main method that starts the game with user defined inputs for game grid width, height, and number of ships (hint: use the arguments of the main method). The main method should create a single instance of Game class.

4.2) The code continuously plays next rounds of the game (i.e., checks for user console input) until termination conditions are met.

4.3) There are two termination conditions:

‚Äì User types a word ‚Äúexit‚Äù. Utilise the method from 3.2.

‚Äì Either player‚Äôs or opponent‚Äôs ships are destroyed. Utilise the method from 3.3

4.4) Input from the player defining attack coordinates should be passed to the playRound method defined in the GameControls interface and implemented in the Game class

4.5) Cathc an exception thrown with an unexpected input (i.e, if users enters anything else apart from ‚Äúexit‚Äù or ‚Äúx,y‚Äù coordinates. When the error occurs print ‚ÄúIncorrect input‚Äù into the console.

Task 5: Report and Code Comments (10 points)

Write a report (5 page max) listing all the tasks and their status (i.e., completed, partially completed, not attempted). For each tasks also include a brief paragraph outlining your approach. At the end of your report include a section with instructions how to run your code. In your .java files, please include comments explaining the purpose of individual functions.
